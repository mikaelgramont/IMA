## Installation
Copy the Google API client secret into `client_secret.json`.

The file at `php/.credentials/credentials.json` needs to be writable on the command line and readable by the web server.
The folder at `php/cache` needs to be writable as well.

Go to `bin. Make `initial-setup.php` executable and run it or do `php initial-setup.php`.
