      <h2 class="display-font">The race course</h2>
      <p>
        The track is located in Bukovac, 15 minutes from the athlete hostel
      </p>
      <p>
        Arguably the fastest track in the World. Just over 700 meters long athletes clear the course in 52 seconds.
        Athletes must navigate 14 turns, numerous rollers and jumps to make it to the finish corral. A challenge for
        even the world’s best but also fun if you manage to slow it down. With the new left hand corkscrew this track
        will possess new challenges and level the regular vs goofy footed playing field.

          <p>
            This hostel features a pool and rooms that become countries. It brings people together and is always a good
            time. If you’re coming to the World Championships to be with the mountainboard family this is the place.

      <h2 class="display-font">Places to eat</h2>
      <p>
        There are many locations to eat in Novi Sad. Here are a few of our favorites and where you will most likely run
        into other athletes:
      </p>
      <ul class="details-list">
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Da Mario Plus</b><br>
            Breakfast and lunch restaurant close to the athlete hostel. They become overwhelmed quickly but have good
            food.<br>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/PkgqvxLy8XbHariJ7">[Google Maps]</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Macak Petrovaradin</b><br>
            Closer to the Varad Inn hostel. Macak is a great pizza joint but everything on the menu is a good bet.<br>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1yPctvhc6tH17syY9">[Google Maps]</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Cafe Modena</b><br>
            A great dining experience in downtown Novi Sad. In the absolute center of town and across from the chapel
            this is a great location. Really good pasta, steaks, and an awesome place to meet up.<br>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/sRY7Qzg4NY3Tj7qg7">[Google Maps]</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Loft Coffee and Food Bar</b><br>
            Located in downtown Novi Sad, not far from the chapel, this restaurant has great breakfast, juice, and
            coffee options.<br>

      <h2 class="display-font">Nightlife</h2>
      <p>
        Again there are many places to enjoy the nightlife in Novi Sad. Most groups will go out together but you will
        never fail to see your fellows athletes on Laze Teleckog. Here are a few of our favorite locations:
      </p>
      <ul class="details-list">
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Puberaj</b><br>
            The location of registration and the “4 Down  Project”. This bar has a great atmosphere and is a local
            hangout spot. Head here for a couple of drinks and a little quieter experience.<br>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hQfqXReA5cJQoJX79">[Google Maps]</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Shamrock Bar</b><br>
            The local Irish bar in Novi Sad. A locals favorite with a fun cocktail list. You can expect to enjoy a fun
            night here on Wednesdays.<br>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/K1WdQGKcbvtW2EMB9">[Google Maps]</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Rakija Spirit Bar</b><br>
            Well versed in Rakija (the local serbian drink) this bar has them all. Pop in to try a couple and then head
            on to enjoy Laze Teleckog. Warning: Don’t stay here to long, things can get blurry.<br>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MwkdhmkJ3ajJwULb7">[Google Maps]</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Lazino Tele</b><br>
            Out of all the bars on Laze Teleckog this one is special. 2 floors of fun and enough room to accommodate all
            of the athletes it always seems to be where everyone ends up at the end of the night. If you come here
            beware, you may have the time of your life and win a world championship.<br>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WkzgXaEHpC7zwvaE6">[Google Maps]</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Cuba Libre</b><br>
            This location is small, sweaty, and the bar you want to be at if you want to have to much of a good time.
            When you walk in keep an eye out for Jereme Leafe. If you find him he’ll buy you a bottle of rakija and
            you’ll watch the sunrise. A staple of the Serbian World Championships.<br>
