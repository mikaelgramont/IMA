  <p>
    With the current status of events in the world (COVID-19) and the cancellation of this year's World Mountainboard
    Championship we have made adjustments to the 4 Down Project in 2020. We are extending the filming window out to 5
    months. This will enable athletes and their teams a better chance to film after social distancing, isolation, and
    quarantines have been lifted. This project was started to create the most current mountainboard content available,
    to showcase what athletes from around the world have been working on, and to stoke the mountainboard world to get
    out and do the same. This year more than ever your fellow mountainboarders will be looking to you for inspiration.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>The edits will be premiered online on September 1st, 2020</b>. The contest will be athlete-judged (online voting) after
    the premiere and there will be a 1st - 4th ranking. There will be a cash purse (it still has yet to be decided since
    sponsorship hasnâ€™t been locked in). They will be posted online immediately after the premiere to show everyone the
    hard work all contestants have been putting into their edits.
