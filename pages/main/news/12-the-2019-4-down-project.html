<p>
  The edits will be premiered at the 2019 World Championships in Novi Sad, Serbia.
  The contest will be rider-judged (online voting) after the premiere and there will be a 1st - 4th ranking.
  There will be a cash purse (though it still has yet to be decided since sponsorship hasn’t been locked in).
  They will be posted online immediately after the premiere to show everyone the hard work all contestants have been
  putting into their edits.
