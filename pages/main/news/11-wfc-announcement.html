    The current park consists of two jumps lines (small/large), rails, drop, and more.
    For the World Championship the jumps and rails will be upgraded to accommodate the riding level that will be
    competing. Next to the park there is a small slope on which a slalom competition will also take place.
    Over the years Mosquito has been one of the best training facilities for athletes from Poland and abroad, and it
    shows. With Polish competitors constantly on the podium at regional to international events.
