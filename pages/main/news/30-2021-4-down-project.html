    Welcome to this yearâ€™s 4 Down Project! We would like to introduce you to this yearâ€™s international video
    competition. The 4 Down Project was started to create the most current mountainboard content, showcase athletes from
    around the world, give teams a platform to promote their progression, and inspire the mountainboard community to do
    the same.
  </p>

  <p>
    As seen with last yearâ€™s projects the format has been adjusted because of the pandemic. Take a look at this yearâ€™s
    format below:
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>The edits will be premiered online on <span class="emphasis">August 16th, 2021</span></b>. The contest will be
    athlete-judged (online voting) after the premiere and there will be a 1st - 4th ranking. There will be a cash purse.
    The edits will be posted online immediately after the premiere to show everyone the hard work all contestants have
    been putting into their edits.
  </p>

  <h2 class="display-font">Get to know the teams</h2>
  <p>
    We asked the teams to give us a little history and description of what mountainboarding looks like in their
    respective countries. Here are their answers:
  </p>

  <h3 class="display-font">Costa Rica ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡·</h3>
  <p>
    Mountainboarding was brought to Costa Rica by a North American named Chad Crow in the early 2000â€™s. Ever since then
    we saw athletes from the US as role models. Looking up to them we took inspiration and started this awesome
    lifestyle.
  </p>
  <p>
    From being a small crew starting with local competitions, to growing in numbers, to meeting new athletes, to riding
    with our own mountainboard heroes personally. Thatâ€™s where this incredible sport has taken us.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have traveled as a team to compete, share, and join the mountainboard communities in Colombia and Brazil.
    Bringing back not only great memories, but also experience and ideas to continue building something important in our
    own country. Weâ€™ve also ridden in Costa Rica with our friends from Argentina, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and
    France in the first Central American Championship. Which you may have seen and gave us more exposure in the
    international mountainboard scene.
  </p>

  <h3 class="display-font">South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦</h3>
  <p>
    Mountainboarding in South Africa is still very underground, just the way we like it. We have a handful of riders in
    Mpumalanga, South Africa and the movement is growing strong. Loads of ladies have been taking up the sport in the
    last couple of years as well. South Africa is a beautiful country and has some incredible freeride terrain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each year we have a gathering called Dirty Dayz. This is a weekend of riding and partying to live music; a complete
    mestival!
  </p>

  <h3 class="display-font">Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­</h3>
  <p>
    Mountainboarding has existed in Switzerland for over 20 years. However it has always been a niche sport.
    Mountainboarders in Switzerland ride mainly bike downhill trails, flow trails, on grass ski lifts, pump tracks or
    alpine roads. Descents can be very long and steep, so it can be beneficial to have a brake with you.
  </p>
  <p>
    95% of swiss athletes ride a mountainboard with brakes. Marco and Dave hate brakes. This film will showcase why
    brakes make sense in the Swiss Alps and why Marco and Dave sweat blood when they ride without them.
  </p>

  <h3 class="display-font">Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦</h3>
  <p>
    The first mountainboard came to Ukraine in the late 1990s in the hands of Serhiy Chervinsky, an action sports
    enthusiast from Kyiv. Athletes of this generation first learned about the sport from Chervinsky's articles in "X3M"
    magazine. As well as a video of the Tartak band "Kozhnetilo", where Serhiy rides across Khreshchatyk on his board.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mountainboarding did not gain much popularity in Ukraine in the early 2000â€™s. In 2008, mountainboard communities
    began to appear in Dnipro, Kyiv and Poltava. After connecting through snowboard forums and ICQ, the first meeting
    was held in Kyiv. There were athletes from Kyiv, Dnipro, Donetsk and Poltava. Afterwards, meetings in various cities
    of Ukraine became regular and the first forum of the Ukrainian mountainboard scene was created. In the following
    years there were many contests. The mountainboard Cups of Ukraine, Karavan Big Air and Z games were held.
  </p>
  <p>
    In recent years, the popularity of the sport has declined. But in Dnipro and Kiev there is a community that
    continues to ride, go to races and shoot videos.
