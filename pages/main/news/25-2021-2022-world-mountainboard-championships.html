    Mountainboarders around the world, we hope you are faring well in these uncertain times. It has been refreshing to
    see athletes beginning to head outside and ride.

    In April the IMA and the Association Mountainboard Compiègne made the decision to cancel the 2020 World
    Championships scheduled in France. It was a tough decision for all parties involved and raised questions about
    future World Mountainboard Championships.<br>
    We are now excited to announce the 2021 World Championships will be held in Compiègne, France and the 2022 World
    Championships will be held in Melbourne, Australia!<br>
    Yes, the schedule has been moved forward a year at both venues. Many thanks to Ludo at Association Mountainboard
    Compiègne and Dylan Warren at Australian Mountainboarders for helping coordinate these moves!

  In closing, we appreciate what each of you bring to the sport and look forward to riding together in the future.
  Practice your 360’s, go a little bit faster and slide that rail. We’ll see you at the World Mountainboard
  Championships in 2021 and 2022!
