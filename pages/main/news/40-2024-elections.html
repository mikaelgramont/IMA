  <h1 class="display-font">WMC24</h1>
  <p>
    We have been receiving more and more requests for details on WMC24, though we regret to announce that it is bad news.
    We were unable to secure a location for WMC24 at this point. It is not the position we wanted to be in, but it is
    the position we have found ourselves in.
  </p>
  <p>
    we recommend taking 2024 as an opportunity to explore other mountainboard events you perhaps wouldn’t have if the
    World Mountainboard Championships had been in the schedule.
  </p>

  <h1 class="display-font">Time for a change</h1>
  <p>
    A mixture of the above WMC24 news and several other things in the last couple of years lead us to a realization
    during 2023 that we’ve been reluctant to accept. <b>It is time for a change.</b> Shifting priorities and commitments
    mean that we find ourselves lacking the time and drive necessary to give the IMA what it needs to not only survive,
    but to thrive.
  </p>
  <p>
    With this in mind, we (Kody, Matt, Mika) will be standing down as the IMA and will be kicking off IMA elections at
    the end of April. Firstly, for new teams to put themselves forward for consideration in the vote, and then to a
    public vote to elect the new President and supporting team.
  </p>

  <h1>What Next</h1>
  <p>
    As previously mentioned, there will be IMA elections so get thinking. <b>Do you have the drive, passion and time to
    commit to being a part of the IMA team? Pull a team together and put yourselves forward for the IMA elections!</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is the schedule we have in mind (subject to change, as nothing is set in stone, and we realize this is all new):
    <ul>
      <li>March 29th - April 29th: candidate teams submit a proposal to mountainboardworld@gmail.com</li>
      <li>
        May 1st - May 15th: voting takes place via a Google Form open to all (please only share with actual
        mountainboarders)
      </li>
      <li>May 16th: results are announced.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the meantime, outside of the official stuff, event organisers can get their events
    <a href="https://www.mountainboardworld.org/events">in the IMA calendar</a>, like every year so that the athletes
    around the World can see what is going on and plan what they want to attend. The Swiss Open, French Open and South
    American Championships have already been announced!
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks for the ride, Kody, Matt, and Mika
