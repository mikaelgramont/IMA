<p>
  We are extremely disappointed and sorry to have to announce that the World Mountainboard Championships 2022, set to be hosted in Australia for the first time, have been cancelled.
</p>

<p>
  Due to unforeseen circumstances with the local authorities, the venue for the event has had to pull out of the competition which has left us with no other option but to cancel the event altogether.
</p>

<p>
  We are aware that some athletes have already booked their flights for the event, and we would like to once again provide our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience and any financial repercussions this is causing. If there is interest, we will attempt to organise some riding with local athletes over the period that the event was scheduled for - please reach out to us if this is something that would interest you.
</p>

<p>
  We would like to make it clear that, as it currently stands, this is not a postponement. If possible, we may look to hold a World Mountainboard Championships in Australia in the future.
</p>

<p>
  As previously announced, the World Mountainboard Championships 2023 will be held in France and the organisers are busy preparing the best event possible with also the World Downhill Championships potentially set to reappear on the calendar for the first time in 11 years.
</p>

</p>
  Again, we are incredibly sorry to have to make this decision and bring this news to you.
<p>

<p>Kody, Mika & Matt</p>
