  scheduled for Dec 14th to 18th at

  For the first time ever, the WMC will take a break from being held in the extended European region, and will take
  place in the southern hemisphere!<br>
  More details will be given in time.

  As you might expect, this is all under the condition that travelling is allowed at the time of the event.
