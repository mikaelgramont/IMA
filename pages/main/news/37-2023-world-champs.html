    <h1 class="display-font">Downhill - July 17th/18th</h1>
    <p>
        If you've been to a World Mountainboard Championship before, chances are you've met Veteran mountainboard
        athlete Vincent Lavaud ("Cambione"). AS it turns out, he's has long had his mind set on hosting a great Downhill
        competition in his home region of Sancy in central France. And that's just what he's doing this year!
    </p>

    <p>
        On the heels of the Boardercross and Freestyle competitions a few days earlier, the Downhill championship is
        going to blow minds with an amazing location, and chairlift access. There will also be a freestyle demo and
        learn to ride sessions for beginners and tourists.
    </p>
