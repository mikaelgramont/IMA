    As you all know, <a href="/news/29-2021-wmc-cancelled">we've had to cancel the 2021 World Mountainboard
    Championships</a> again this year due to the health risks and to the financial risk of running a low-turn out event
    for the organizers, the Assocation Mountainboard Compiègne (AMC).
  </p>

  <p>
    However, the great news is that the AMC and L.A. Mountainboard Park clubs are setting up a week-long summer camp
    at their two parks! Both are world-class mountainboard parks, and if you're looking for an opportunity to train
    there and at other locations, you should definitely attend!
  </p>

  <p>
    Below are details provided by them.

    The Camp will be mostly about chill and ride with friends at the L.A Mountainboard Park near Nantes, <b>from July
    10th to the 13th</b>, then transfer to Compiègne to enjoy the spot and the work done for the canceled WMC21.
