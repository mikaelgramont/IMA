<h2 class="display-font">The format</h2>
<p>
  All athletes, family, friends, spectators, and stray dogs will descend to the bar after qualifying on Friday the 6th
  of September. They will be asked to grab beers, or rakia, and line either side of the road that crosses the race
  course.
</p>
<p>
  16 athletes will be selected based on how good they think they are and how good we believe they will be after falling
  on a track and having to tick tack for speed. Head to head racing will then commence!<br>
  After a brief introduction explaining why the athletes selected are underqualified to compete these infamous words
  will be shouted “Racer’s ready, attention, TICK TACK!” At this point athletes will start from a dead stop and have to
  tick tack their way down the road and towards the finish line. There will be a 500 Dinar note waiting for them at the
  finish and the athlete that holds this note at the end of the race will move on to the next round. The loser will
  receive a free beer and will be asked to rejoin the rest of the delinquents standing on the sidelines. Racing will
  continue until there are 2 athletes left. In the last round athletes will race for 2000 Dinar, a bottle of Rakia, and
  the coveted <em>“Golden Heelstrap”</em> award.

<p>
  Congratulations, you are the World’s Fastest Tick Tacker!
</p>

<h2 class="display-font">The rules</h2>
<p>
  The rules are simple. No pushing with your feet, no grabbing your fellow athlete, and stay in your lane. To the
  animals (spectators) on the side of the road... do not impede the athletes, do not stand on the asphalt, and get wild!
</p>

<p>
  In all seriousness this is meant to be a fun contest to stoke everyone’s love for mountainboarding. Something to bring
  us together after a long day of racing and put a smile on everyone’s face.
</p>

<p>
  We would like to thank Trampa for their sponsorship of this event. They have supported mountainboarding for years and
