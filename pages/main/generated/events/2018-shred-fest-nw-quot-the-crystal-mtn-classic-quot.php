This will be a most celebratory occasion and we will do honor to the good name of our sport, our community and our elders. Our Annual Shred Fest events are serious competitions to provide the spectrum of riders with a chance to push themselves to perform and to get better while having the most fun. Its very serious, we take having fun with our friends once a year seriously and this year will be seriously radical at 6,000&#039;.
Club members will assemble a camp and provide accommodations for all who cannot bring their own gear. Just let us know and also whether you&#039;ll need airport rides. This saves everybody from having to rent a room or a car. Just bring your board and well get you from the AP.
Get at us over here. We&#039;re real with it. This is an open invite to come have a rip sesh and to challenge your inner big wave mountainside rider for points and honours against the likes of pro&#039;s, legends, new riders, and who knows who else. A true family event. Get there. We are Stoked!</p>
