  The ATBAswitzerland has held the Swiss Downhill Open on August 17 in Flumserberg. It has been a while since
  Switzerland has seen a Mountainboard competition for the last time. It was 6 years ago in Appenzell and 9 years ago
  in Fruttigen, to be exactly. This year 2019 is very special for the ATBAswitzerland, we celebrate our 10th
  anniversary. So it was really important to us to celebrate this with a Mountainboard Downhill Open.
</p>
<p>
  Switzerland has no Mountainboard centers, but we have many Bike parks which allow mountainboarders. One of the best
  bike downhill trails is the Blue Salamander in Flumserberg, because it is nice and flowy over 3.8 km, with loads of
  banks, rollers, jumps and wallrides and most important, you can ride it with and without brakes.

  The racing mode was completely open. All riders in one category. Every rider had the chance to do as many runs as he
  wanted, within a time window of 5 hours. Even for time measuring, everyone was responsible himself. We were using GPS
  based time measuring, supported by the <a href="https://racechrono.com/">RaceChronoApp</a> on the riders smartphones.

<p>
  At the beginning of the race, riders started with some easy runs. Riding a 3.8 km long downhill trail is quite
  exhausting. Some riders even took a rest half way. But starting to compare their times at the bottom, the time attack
  has started. Riders pushed more and more, working out strategies to have a clear run, and improved their times over
  and over. Marco Dähler did some of the fastest times of the day and took the 1st place. TJ got very close in one of
  his runs, but could not improve with his other attempts and finished 2nd. The biggest fight happened for 3rd Place.
  For a long time David Hutter was leading, having Luzi Kölla close in his neck. But it was Kalle Janousch who did huge
  improvements in each run and jumped ahead of David and Luzi in his last run of the day.

  Last but not least, we know some of you love statistics. We took some statistic data during registration and prepared
  the following visuals, which may speak for themselves.
