	<h1>Congratulations!</h1>

	<p>You have been selected to be a part of a very special video project. This project has been been started to create the most current content available, to showcase what athletes from around the world have been working on, and to stoke the mountainboard world to get out and do the same.</p>

	<p>The edits will be premiered at the <b>2018 World Championships in Kranj, Slovenia</b>. The contest will be rider-judged and there will be a 1st - 4th ranking. There will be a cash purse (though it still has yet to be decided since sponsorship hasn’t been locked in). They will be posted online soon after to show everyone the hard work all contestants have been putting into their edits.</p>

	<h2>The Contestants are:</h2>
	<ul class="contestants">
		<li>Dylan Warren <span class="country">(Aus)</span></li>
		<li>Phil Elnieh <span class="country">(Ger)</span></li>
		<li>Amon Shaw <span class="country">(UK)</span></li>
		<li>Mason Moore <span class="country">(US)</span></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>The Guidelines are:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p class="primary">Project starts on March 25, 2018</p>
			<p class="secondary">That gives all contestants 90 days to complete their projects.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class="primary">The edit can be no longer than 8 minutes.</p>
			<p class="secondary">That doesn’t mean it has to be 8 minutes. Just no longer than 8 minutes. Trying to keep these edits short, sweet, and to the point.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class="primary">Each contestant can choose 2-3 featured athletes</p>
			<p class="secondary">You can have as many athletes as you want in the edit but the edit is easier to explain when referenced as “Jon Smith presents “Spin to Win” featuring Jimmy, Frank, and Gretchen”.</p>
			<p class="secondary">Another example to further explain the difference between featured athletes and others: Featured athlete Frank was riding with Josh, Matt, and Billy. Rather than Frank, Josh, Matt, and Billy were riding together.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class="primary">A one-minute trailer must be supplied by June 1, 2018.</p>
			<p class="secondary">This is important. This way we can create excitement for the project and promote the premiere at the World Championships in Slovenia.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class="primary">Final edit completed by June 22, 2018</p>
			<p class="secondary">This will give us a week to get everything together and prepare for the premiere.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>All contestants have access to, and ride different terrains. Take that freedom to express what mountainboarding is to you. Athletes may be spread all over the globe but we share something special in common.</p>

	<p>A Facebook messenger group will be started with all parties involved. As details emerge you will be the first to know.</p>

	<p>If you have any questions you can direct them there or you can contact me directly: <a href="mailto:colabmtb@gmail.com">Kody Stewart</a></p>
