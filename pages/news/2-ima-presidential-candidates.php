						What is your experience with mountainboarding, and running a sports club or group?
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>I have been riding since 1999 in the Olympia, WA area and I formed MOUNTAINBOARDS NORTH WEST (NW) in 2013 to create a way to meet other Mountainboarders to ride with. It was lonely coming up riding alone a lot and not having a scene to rely on so finally we, The Club, make a scene and have given our region highly praised recognition</p>
						<p>I offer free Learn to rides in my community, I "Adopted a Road" in my hometown of Tumwater, WA in the name of Mountainboards NW, and I organize the Annual Shred Fest NW Competition/festival every summer.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>
						If you are running as a team, please list the names of your team members and maybe some of their experience.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>#1 <b>Alex Rossiter</b> (me), #2 <b>Jay D</b>, #3- <b>Zach Kiesz</b>.</p>
						<p>Jay is the only other remaining founding member of The Club. He has helped with both Shred Fest NWs and last year it was in his back yard and we split all costs. He is the most trustworthy guy and he's stoked on the community.</p>
						<p>Zach is the next oldest member of the team and he called me up one day and he became a member right away. He's a fucking wildman and he's the nicest dude.</p>
						<p>I will plan to rely on the two of them to help me accomplish my goals and also to be inside council to me for any decision making and or mediations which I may face in my role as President of (not only the club) the IMA.<br>
						I have a list of mentors whom I rely on for advice and none of which will deny that I've called them, asked what I should do, and then done it to positive avail. I also ask these 2 other riders and friends of mine for advice or at least their opinions on decisions I make or actions which I take especially when it reflects the good of The Club. this is why I know I will be able to trust their opinions when I need them and be able to use them for any other more practicable matters which may arise since at least zach lives pretty close by.<br>
						I plan to foot most of the work and shoulder the consequences myself, but, these are my 2 closest guys so they'll come in with me to be used as I see fit. the two choices which I have listed may change and other people may be used for specific functions along the way too. it's not a limiting list but a semblance of a small council which I trust with my life.			
					</dd>

					<dt>
						What do you intend to do as President? What do you think the IMA should be doing and how would you work towards that goal?
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p><b>Plan #1</b> - A directory for Mountainboarders. I think the IMA website should have a directory where riders can choose to list their info and be known. I believe this falls well within the larger goals of the IMA and will be useful, although not mandatory, to all Mountainboarders whether they're looking for someone to ride with in the next state over or a different country. We will be able to look at, for instance, Washington and be able to find me and other members to hit up to ride. Or if you want to go to another country, you could search the directory and find somebody to hook up with to either stay with or ride with or whatever.</p>
						<p><b>Plan #2</b> - A registry for Brands. I feel similarly as I do with the directory. We need a central listing of all rider-owned Mountainboarding brands so we will know where to get the indie stuff and keep our market alive and in the hands of Mountainboarders where it belongs. It is the micro market, the boarder owned industry which will make our sport "great" and keep it always in the hands of those who truly love it...the riders. This registry won't be an endorsement of any company nor participate in favoritism, it will be designed like the white pages for the directory and the yellow pages for the rider-owned companies. There will be no cost to register and be listed nor will it be required to participate. It's just something that's missing which we could all use to benefit our own riding experiences and the community as a whole.</p>
						<p><b>Plan #3</b> - To act as a Mediator {and/or} Arbitrator. If an election is necessary to appoint the President of the IMA then there is shown a certain amount of respect for the individual elected and it could be a good way to use that person to help resolve differences. He or she could act as a Judge and offer well-informed opinions on issues which are voluntarily brought before them. Say two Mountainboarders get into an argument; one of them reaches out to the IMA for advice on how to proceed, now the IMA President can look into the matter and form an opinion of their own and offer it to the affected parties as a proposed solution. If the matter were to involve the good of the IMA itself then the President would act as Arbitrator as the president should have final say on issues arising from or resulting in the actions of the Association. I have a Paralegal degree as well as a liberal arts degree, I'm a life coach and a student of ancient esoteric schools of thought. this way disputes can be put to rest once and for all when the Pres IMA weighs in and the riders can go back to being friends. Rather than never finding any closure nor outside opinion which isn't biased to look at all the facts and present his or her findings openly to both parties at the same time once the conclusion is reached by him or her. Again, matters involving the IMA the decisions will be final and mandatory, however, issues raised by and involving other riders will be brought to me voluntarily and be decisive and non-biased and for the betterment of the heritage of our sport but will be non-binding. Non-binding means that the IMA President will not act in that capacity to punish in any way any rider who doesn't appear to be following the directives offered in any opinion. there is really no way to punish them except to remove any directory or registry listings they may have but that won't happen either. This function of the job will serve to help the community not to play favorites or just to be right but it will be a good way to settle shit it a good way. i'm not saying that I as the new President plan to disrupt the acting structure which makes the IMA work as well as it does today just to disrupt it but rather to add a function which I'm willing to facilitate as a mediator and or arbitrator. </p>
						<p><b>Plan #4</b> - Focus Group Facilitator - I am one and I could foresee formalizing a process for Mountainboarders to use as they get industrious to help them along their way with their own plans or ideas. Furthermore, to be a mentor to the members of our community both young and old in their careers. A cool head with the best interest of all riders at heart.</p>

						What is your experience with mountainboarding, and running a sports club or group?
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>I have an accomplished background in mountainboarding.<br>
						I started riding in September of 2000 and entered the professional ranks in 2003. I have been competing in the sport for 15 years and have held multiple world titles/podiums from 2004 onward. Most noteably a Junior World Championship in 2004, US Open Champion in 2008, and World Champion in 2013.</p>

						<p>Though what I believe qualifies me the most for this position is what I have accomplished outside of the sport. From 2007 onward, I have had an extensive action sports events background. Working for companies such as Red Bull, Fox Racing, and numerous other marketing agencies. I have learned how to produce and market world class events. From conceptualization, to marketing, to execution, I believe we can create beneficial experiences for athletes and spectators alike.</p>

						<p>I also started Colab Mountainboards. It was a project to prove that we as mountainboarders can change the sport that we are passionate about. It has been a highly successful movement with other riders creating their own startups.</p>

						If you are running as a team, please list the names of your team members and maybe some of their experience.

					<dd>
						<p>My team in this project are a couple of fellow athletes that I truly believe in.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>The first being <b>Matt Brind</b>. His accolades are stunning. By far the most decorated athlete on the team and the driving force behind mountainboard progression for several years now. Matt Brind has stood atop the podium at almost every contest you can. Winning the last 4 World BX Championships from 2014-2017, the 2012 World Freestyle Championships, and taking home the UK Overall Championship for the last 9 years. He has pushed the sport on and off the track. Also starring in Nitro Circus shows around the world.</p>
								<p>Back home Matt is an essential piece to the ATBA-UK organization. Helping them out since 2009 Matt has ran some of the largest events in mountainboard history. He’s known as being the most unbiased when it comes to race formats and spends much of his time crunching numbers on how to create better experiences for athletes at events. With Matt on the team I believe we can create world class events without any hiccups. His eye for detail, web experience, previous experience with the IMA, and title as world champion makes him a great ambassador for the sport.</p>
							</li><li>
								<p>The next fellow athlete I would be running with is <b>Mikael Gramont</b>.</p>
								<p>Mika has been riding since 2000 and has a solid feel for the pulse of our sport. He was French Freestyle Champion in 2003 and has ridden in international events around the globe. He co-started the mountainboarding team and mountainboard park in Toulouse. He has an extensive background in web development and has already used his experience to launch both IMA and Colab websites, as well as the French mountainboard.fr site. He is open minded, goal oriented, and organized. Colab wouldn’t have happened without him and he will bring great experience to the Association.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>

					<dt>
						What do you intend to do as President? What do you think the IMA should be doing and how would you work towards that goal?
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>My place in the IMA will be to bring us all closer together, and we'll start with the following:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Creating better standardized events and bringing back cash purses on the international stage. We will create formal event formats for large international events, as well as cater to regional events' individual needs. We will bring back cash purses by incorporating a percentage system based on how many athletes register to participate.</li>
						
							<li>Setting up basics such as creating a monthly newsletter to keep us all better connected, creating and collecting content from all over the world. That way we stay up to date on each other’s happenings with event reports, rider bios, vlogs, blogs, and mountainboard news.</li>
						
							<li>Consolidating the IMA's presence on social networks for a more efficient communication online.</li>

							<li>Helping tried and tested mountainboard instructor programs get replicated in more countries.</li>

							<li>Working with other members of the IMA to learn and create programs that are beneficial to their regions.</li>

						</ul>
						<p>We can build a better sport. The best part of mountainboarding is that even though we all come from different backgrounds we have found a mutual passion. It will take all of us to make a difference but in the end we’ll have something that we’re proud of.</p>
