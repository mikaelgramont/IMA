<p>
    The essence of the IMA is to bring the internation mountainboarding community together and to help it grow.<br>
    So far, the current IMA board has focused on the World Mountainboard Championship, the 4-down video project, the
    newsletter, and a presence on the web and on social media.
</p>
<p>
    One thing we think is important, and which Diego Anderson used to put a lot of effort in, is coordination across
    countries. Things like avoiding date overlaps for big events, providing support for racing and judging, hosting
    official event results, directing sponsors or other interested parties towards the right person in a given country,
    etc.

    This could be a full-time job, and so after a late-night discussion with Flavio at the WMC18, we offered him the job.
    He accepted so we're excited to announce that we're bringing him in as an International Relations Specialist.<br>
    Welcome to the IMA, Flavio!
</p>
<p>
    If you're an event organiser or club owner, don't be surprised if Flavio reaches out, he's here to help! :)
