<p>Please read in a Troy McClure from the Simpsons voice, it's supposed to be funny like that...</p>

<p class="quote">“Hi my name is Arno VdV. Some of you might remember me from competitions and demos all over Europe, or just travelling with my board and riding with friends. I have also starred in many self-made movieclips called: The Ride Along Series. Besides that i have been actively involved in the scene and have worked at Wanyi park for a couple years.”</p>

<p>Anyway, I am getting old now and here are some memberberries from me riding over the last decade and a half. Nothing will be very chronological but i will try to make sense.</p>

<p>I remember back in 2004 I went to a Mountainboard competition in Morzine, France. I was going to participate in the downhill but was more excited for the freestyle comp. I had been invited by the late Gammytoes and Poombag, who no longer ride with us, to come over to a big event on the infamous ATBMag Big Ramp. This was going to be at the Town and Country festival in Coventry, UK and i could possibly join the ATBMAG team! Of course I agreed!!!</p>


<p>A few weeks later I went to the event to meet the rest of the team and had a blast with them.<br>
At the end of the event I got news about a big tour coming up in 2005 with a biiig budget so we could have our own tour bus and all!!!<br>
But first up we had a demo booked at Hogmanay. Edinburgh's mega NYE party which goes on for a week. This is the memberberry i want to feed you all.</p>

<p>I traveled to the UK by bus to get to J and Anni's house and ATBMag's HQ. I met up with the crew and loaded up to go Edinburgh. If I member it right, Paul Taylor drove me, Tom Kirkman, Laurie Kaye and Tuai Lovejoy to Edinburgh where we stayed in The George. The oldest and most luxurious hotel in the city we were been told. Ig wilkinson, Jack Chew and the rest of the K-family were present too, but i can’t really member how...probably by hot air balloon.</p>

<p>This hotel was rented out by the organisation who used it mainly for the performing artists. We shared it with the likes of the Scissor Sisters and some other big names I didn't care about much...<br>
Imagine a group of mountainboarders arriving at a posh hotel with their big and weird boards. Completely taking over the main hall by loading all their stuff into one big pile. We sure saw some raised eyebrows and polite but disapproving coughs and clearing throats.</p>

<p>After getting settled in our rooms we met in the lobby to see the night’s entertainment. Which was spread out with stages all over the city. We met up with the local mountainboarders and had a shimmy down at some Levellers kind of band followed by some electronic hip hop tribal beats.<br>
We decided to not make it too late as we were supposed to get everything set up the next day. Since we were riding the day after on New Year's Day. We did have a party like true mountainboarders though...</p>

<p>The organisation had planned us to set up the Big Ramp somewhere next to the Queens' garden.<br>
Arriving on site we saw that the floorboards they provided were in fact big aluminium plates with a groove in them providing extra grip. These looked like tank treads and if i had found a block  of cheese big enough i could have proven how good this would work as an industrial size cheesegrater. Point being, you definitely didn't want to fall on these!! They placed them on top of a sloping hill giving us a hard time determining the distance between the roll in and the kicker but we managed. It was also a good moment for young Mick and Jos Kirkman to drop in for their first time. They both did it on skatetrucks!!! We all had a few jumps to get comfortable and did some minor adjustments until everybody felt ok to ride it in a show.</p>

<p>After setting up the kit we went back for a shower and a good meal around the hotel. As we were in for a biiiig party night and a demo the day after.<br>
I don't really remember much from the meal we had besides it was big and good hearty food. When it was time to party we met up in the hotel lobby to go out and paint the town. Things got hectic pretty quick and we lost sight of some people. But after a while we found each other. Then after a couple hours of adventures in the town we got split up with other people again and so on and so on. We all had a few drinks too many and made too many friends to even remember their names. But if you guys remember us, that was cool bruh!! By 3 in the morning everything was misty and i lost the guys. Some new friends dragged me along a bit more and i eventually staggered home past streetfights and people spewing(oh scotland!!). Arriving at the hotel i saw somebody getting bottled in the face in 0.0000000034secs (i timed it). So i went for a longer stroll around town to do some more fight-seeing before heading off to bed in the early morning.</p>

<p>After a couple hours of sleep i woke up to a raging storm outside of the hotel and inside my head (damn guinness and whisky). ATBMag J decided it was too dangerous to ride. The storm was supposed to become stronger around noon and was not going to finish until dusk. So we decided to take the whole setup down and have a lazy hangover day.</p>

<p>After one of the sketchiest deconstructions involving playing lawn darts with the scaffold pieces in stormwinds and some scary roll in winching on a dancing tower we finally managed to load up the truck and get it stuck in the grass. Joint efforts helped us get even wetter as it was pouring down by then. The truck tires were spinning while we were pushing and it gave us all a nice shade of brown. I was too awake and motivated to ride so Ig and I got everybody motivated to have a street session. (Edinburgh's nothing but hills and stairs and banks and rails and some houses in between of that).</p>

<p>We went back to the hotel to get our gear ready and had one of the funnest sessions ever. Hitting every curb, jump, bank or whatever was in our paths on the way down. The rain made it a bit more forgiving to slide and in case of a crash you had less friction. We ended up finding a sidewalk with some raised flower beds on each side which had 1.5m banks opposing each other. Making it a wallride-halfpipe-pyramid like feature. We sessioned that for a while before heading down to the Vue cinema to have a play on the stair set in front of their lobby.</p>

<p>We attracted quite a lot of attention as you can imagine. Many folks that day decided to go to a New Year's day cinema instead of taking the typical walk out in the gardens or the surrounding hills. Also, what idiot would actually go out in the rain to play??!! Yes, that's right, an over excited mountainboarder that is in a strange town with lots of like-minded people, AKA me!!</p>

<p>This memberry is one of my best as we all had the greatest time in the poorest condition. Only pure love for the sport and motivation to ride together made it this way. It has proven to me exactly what mountainboarding is capable of and what it's all about. Also, this was the start of an epic mountainboarding year for me that would definitely give me some of the greatest life experiences a human can have.</p>


<p>I would like to thank J and Anni over and over again. Along with Maarten and Jeroen from the Belgian mountainboard association, for the way they influenced my life so i can still enjoy and continue making these priceless experiences...</p>
<p>So much love,</p>


<p>Ride On!!! (everything)</p>
