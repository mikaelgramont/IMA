<h1 class="display-font">About the IMA</h1>
<p class="paragraph">
	The 2002 Morzine Mountainboard Fest was truly the first international mountainboarding competition. Set in the French Alps, it brought together riders from all over Europe, and started the first international efforts to coordinate the promotion of mountainboarding.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	After a few years of involvement in various events and communities, Diego Anderson started leading national clubs and associations towards a more professional side of the sport. In 2009, the International Mountainboard Association (IMA) was born and it took on efforts such as event regulation and standardization, and calendar coordination.

<p class="paragraph">
	The IMA is now looking forward to pushing mountainboarding further by providing support for event organizers, sponsors and media.
